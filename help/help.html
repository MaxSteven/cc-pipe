<p>This is a quick guide on getting started using cc-pipe.</p>

<h4>Setting up</h4>
<p>
	Before creating a project you must specify where the root of 
	the projects will live. This can be anywhere, for example the 
	top level of a drive share etc. Click settings at the bottom 
	to open the settings file and specify the full path where it 
	says repo.
</p>

<h4>The interface</h4>

<p>
	The layout is split into projects on the left hand side and shots on the right. The structure is as follows:
</p>
<p>
	Project>Shot>Software>Task
</p>
<p>
	The buttons below the layout are self explanatory, note that you 
	must make a Project before making a shot, shot before task etc.
	You can delete a project or shot using the 2 labelled buttons.
</p>
<p>
	When creating a new project you will see the window below. This 
	is the new project window and when you have filled in the 
	information it will generate a new project for you.

<p>
	Creating a new shot is simple, just choose the project you'd 
	like to make one in, click New Shot and fill in the name.
</p>

<p>
	To add a task, select the shot you'd like and then click New 
	Task. The window will ask if you'd like to make a Houdini or 
	Nuke structure andn choose whichever is suitable. If the 
	software is something else you can simply choose other and 
	it will create a folder for the software but no further structure.

<h4>Launching Software</h4>
<p>
	To launch software you must go to the task folder first before launching. You don't have to, but if you don't it won't pick 
	up the relevant environment variables that help make cc-pipe 
	so useful.
